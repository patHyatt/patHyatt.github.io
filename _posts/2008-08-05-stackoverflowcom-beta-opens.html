Well Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky have finally opened up their new venture <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, a site for programmers by programmers. It's a <span style="font-weight:bold;">registration free</span> experts-exchange like site which has some neat features. <br /><br />For one if you choose to register it uses an openID account, which is usable throughout various other web sites bypassing that 500th login/password combo you were going to create again.<br /><br />Another quirky item is the default icons for each user. They have implemented use of a gravatar which basically translates to a unique image per user based on their IP address. Heres an example: <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df0eee24254231e5393a7c5cfc4c3a0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df0eee24254231e5393a7c5cfc4c3a0e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I've been very impressed with the simplicity of design while maintaining a slick minimalistic feel. All in all I wish the best for this site and hope everyone gets a chance to check it out.
