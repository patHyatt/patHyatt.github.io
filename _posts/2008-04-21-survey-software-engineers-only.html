In support of my significant other's research and graduate studies, I would wish to ask some of my readers (any of whom are professional software developers) to complete this survey. It is a short survey pertaining to the ailments of sitting on our butts all day writing code. There is only enough free survey for 15 people before the service wants to charge, so it is on a first come first serve basis.<br /><br />Academia and me would like to thank you for those that complete this. (By the way no personal information is used in this)<br /><br />To the survey! :: <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB227Q9VQZL82">Survey</a>
