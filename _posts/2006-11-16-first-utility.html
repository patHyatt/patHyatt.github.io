I did say I would post my developing accomplishments and solutions, and finally I have completed one.<br /><br />This utility compresses tiff images using <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">CCITT</span> Group 4 compression. Initially the images were specified as "black and white" therefore I checked for 1 bit color, however it was later changed to support any bit depth. Images can be 1,4,8,12,16, 24 or 32 bit. I made use of 3rd party components from <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">LeadTools</span>, which made compressing and saving a snap. However the very large images (1GB and up) just wreck a machine with little memory.<br /><br />Being this was/is my first ground up professional app I found out the hard way where things go wrong.<br /><ul><li>Check your I/O - file <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">I/O</span> will smoke you if you are not checking for success</li><li>Check your Database data, not checking this will smoke you</li><li>Use useful debugging messages<br /></li></ul>Mind you for any developer this is standard duh material or should be, however I've been working on automated builds (visual build) and wise for windows installer for over a year, I knew I was rusty, but wow.
