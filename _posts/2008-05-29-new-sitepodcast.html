Recently I posted a few of sites I frequent everyday <a href="http://www.patrickhyatt.com/2008/03/daily-sites.html">Daily Sites</a>.<br />One of them being <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">Coding Horror</a> run by Jeff Atwood a now ex developer of Vertigo Software. <br /><br />Recently Jeff has parted with Vertigo in hopes of starting a new venture in partnership with <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> (Founder of FogBugz). That venture being <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. It is still in its infancy as they discuss what it will be and how they will implement the site. The main premise is basically a more community based Experts Exchange focused solely on software development. <br /><br />If you are a developer I highly recommend both Coding Horror and StackOverflow. We not only need great readings and community based knowledge bases, but also to support our fellow developers who wish to further advancement of the field.
