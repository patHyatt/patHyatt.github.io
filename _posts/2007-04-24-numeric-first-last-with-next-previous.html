<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:arial;">Hello everyone (Im the only reader?)</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Long time since I last posted as I have not encountered anything that I felt was worth a post so that explains the lengthy duration.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Anyhow as the title suggests:</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">.Net GridView PagerSettings by default give you 4 options most useful , yet at times you may want something extra; such as a Numeric First/Last with previous and next paging ability. I was tasked with this and couldn't find anything that was not overly complex (required a custom pager etc). I found one blog (link to come if i can find it again) that had some customization taking place during the RowCreated Event. After thinking about it I threw it together.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">First Set the GridView PagerSettings to "NumericFirstLast"</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">this will give you a pager that resembles the following:</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">1 ... 5 6 7 ... 10, where the "...",s will increment to the n number of documents.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Next wire up an event handler for the OnRowCreated Event. The following code explains the rest:</span><br /><br /><code style="font-family: arial;">switch (e.Row.RowType)<br />      {<br />          case DataControlRowType.Pager:<br />              Table pagerTable = (Table)e.Row.Cells[0].Controls[0];<br />              TableRow row = pagerTable.Rows[0];<br />              if (row.Cells.Count > 1)<br />              {<br />                  LinkButton prev = row.Cells[1].Controls[0] as LinkButton;<br />                  if (prev != null &&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; prev.Text == "...")<br />                  {<br />                      prev.Text = "<<;                            prev.CommandArgument = "Prev";                        }                        LinkButton next = row.Cells[row.Cells.Count - 2].Controls[0] as LinkButton;                        if (next != null &&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; next.Text == "...")                        {                            next.Text = ">>";<br />                      next.CommandArgument = "Next";<br />                  }<br />              }<br />              break;<br />}<br /></code><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Basically when the pager row is created, we find the linkbutton on either side that jump pages forwards and backwards (the ...'s ) and reconfigure them to display the appropriate text we want and commandarguments. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Thus giving you a numeric first last and next/previous pager style with minimal work. </span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">The code above resembles the following :</span><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">1 &lt;&lt; 5 6 7 &gt;&gt; 10</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">And thats all from me for now. Good, Bad or Ugly ? you be the judge..</span></span>
