I've not posted in so long, my massive audience has now probably stopped following. Sorry loyal followers! <br /><br />I must admit, I feel I just don't offer enough as a developer to post compared to other avid/interesting bloggers. And as of recently I've been in a development lull. <br />No interesting discoveries, no new tools I've dabbled with, nothing really.<br /><br />Recent work has changed from a News harvester to a rewrite of a very high traffic site.<br />While it is exciting/new/challenging, I'm just tanking in enthusiasm. <br /><br />Ah well, pity me huh?<br /><br />Recent things I can blurb about:<br /><br />-Read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=papa00-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321344758">Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=papa00-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321344758" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> By Steve Krug.<br />Thoughts: Very easy read and sensible book on usability. Life changing? No, but sometimes I think you need to get smacked in the face with obviousness to realize things. For example the chapter on web usability I found really informative.<br /><br />-Going to Spain! As we try to do every few years, we are getting out of the U.S. for a duet of weeks to see exactly what Spain is about. Very excited about this, and the excitement is growing as the days counting continue downward.<br /><br />That's about all I can dump off the mind at the moment. I believe it is a glimpse at my lull.<br /><br />Ah well.... as Johnny Cash said, Drive on...
