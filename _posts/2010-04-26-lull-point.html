I've not posted in so long, my massive audience has now probably stopped following. Sorry loyal followers! <br /><br />I
must admit, I feel I just don't offer enough as a developer to post compared to other avid/interesting bloggers. And as
of recently I've been in a development lull. <br />No interesting discoveries, no new tools I've dabbled with, nothing
really.<br /><br />Recent work has changed from a News harvester to a rewrite of a very high traffic site.<br />While it
is exciting/new/challenging, I'm just tanking in enthusiasm. <br /><br />Ah well, pity me huh?<br /><br />Recent things
I can blurb about:<br /><br />-Read <a

    Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition</a><img

    alt="Book image - Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug" /> By Steve Krug.<br />Thoughts: Very easy read and sensible
book on usability. Life changing? No, but sometimes I think you need to get smacked in the face with obviousness to
realize things. For example the chapter on web usability I found really informative.<br /><br />-Going to Spain! As we
try to do every few years, we are getting out of the U.S. for a duet of weeks to see exactly what Spain is about. Very
excited about this, and the excitement is growing as the days counting continue downward.<br /><br />That's about all I
can dump off the mind at the moment. I believe it is a glimpse at my lull.<br /><br />Ah well.... as Johnny Cash said,
Drive on...
