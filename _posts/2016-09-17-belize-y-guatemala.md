# Buenos Dias

Last Sunday (the 11th) I got back from a vacation that deviated; both from our top places and in activities.

Of course based on the title, you smart folk can identify that it was Belize and Guatemala.

## Reasoning

There were two points to our trip:
 1. My wife and I got married legally in a courthouse in July and had a small gathering to celebrate it.
We made sure to tell immediate family that a real ceremony, that we wanted, was to be had
and that if they were to make any of the two events this was it. This was also the one time in our lives we could
almost force family to get together and vacation (see point #2 below)
 2. Vacation. We love and thoroughly enjoy jumping into other cultures and areas of the world to better understand
 things and people.

So how did Belize come into the picture?
We're both green people. That is, we'd prefer green trees and surroundings to beach fronts.
So talking through our dreamy place to have a *small* ceremony and vacation at, somewhere in a rainforest
perked up to both our ears.

Initially Costa Rica was the spot, but after a few emails to places we wanted to stay, it was determined we were unable to find a spot that had enough lodging for all of us, sad but true.
In our rush, we geographically went upward. After some more emails for lodging, Belize had a initial launch pad and place for ceremony. Game on.

The schedule, yielding what we think is maximum coverage and immersion:
- Mountain Pine Ridge, Belize ([Gaia Riverlodge](http://www.gaiariverlodge.com/)) - 4 nights
- Tikal, Guatemala ([Tikal Inn](http://www.tikalinnsunrise.com/)) - 1 night
- San Ignacio, Belize [(AirBnB - Yarl Villa](www.airbnb.com/c/patrickh531)) - 2 nights
- Crooked Tree, Belize [Birds Eye View Lodge](http://www.birdseyeviewbelize.com/) - 1 night
- Caye Caulker ([AirBnB - Princesa Angienelle](www.airbnb.com/c/patrickh531)) - 2 nights


## Packing
Per my post, [Ultralight Travel](/2016/03/27/ultralight-travel.html), mobility is key when traveling. The following image is what I took for this particular vacation.
