Recently I've been evaluating what I've done in my life and how I've impacted others lives around me. To be honest, I recently noticed that I had the mindset of taking care of myself and myself only. With this invading my mind, I figured it is time to change some. Something small, something I can ease off with (hey, its a start) and still feel like I'm making some difference. <br /><br />    My significant other is one of the most giving people I know. She signed up a while ago on a site called <a href="http://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>. Today I signed up and made my first donation toward a loan. Meet Mr. Abdul Sabor Mohammad (Right ad/banner), a DVD video exporter in Kabul. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update</span> Abdul's loan has been fulfilled and the banner has been updated to reflect another Entrepreneur in need.<br /><br /><br />I can't say I feel like I can and/or have changed the world. But if I gave one family the chance at a fraction of what I've had, its a pretty good thought/feeling.
