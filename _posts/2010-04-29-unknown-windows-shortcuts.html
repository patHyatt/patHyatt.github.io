Most keyboards these days have the Microsoft logo'ed Windows key. This key is simply magic.<br /><br />For example hold that key down and tap the 'E' key.<br />My computer just pops up, bam! Navigate away.<br /><br />Windows key + 'R' : The run prompt shows up ready to do your bidding. <br /><br />Couple this with the different service consoles or applications (services.msc or notepad++ for example) and you are just getting around without even taking your hands off the keyboard.<br /><br />Windows key + 'D' : Minimize all visible applications, OR re-display visible applications as their previous display. Try it, its amazing.<br /><br />Most of these are known and used everyday, however there are a few people I show are still wowed by. And recently <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5526025/make-the-most-of-your-multiple-monitors-in-windows-7">Lifehacker</a> posted some Windows 7 tips that wowed me.<br /><br />If you're using Windows 7 with multiple monitors you just <span style="font-style:italic;">have</span> to use these.<br /><br />Windows + Up Arrow = Maximizes active window<br />Windows + Down Arrow = Un-maximizes active full screened window OR minimizes active windowed application.<br />Windows + Left (or Right) Arrow = Cycles window in direction of arrow key across monitors. Amazing!<br /><br /><br />I've been loving this since I learned about it, just changes everything!
