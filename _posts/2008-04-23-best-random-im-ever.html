11:21 AM Tuesday April 23<br />Random IM comes on my screen from a coworker at a previous gig. One who I really don't talk to much anymore...<br /><br />Any identifications have been removed to protect the guilty:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_K0T9JgGHK5g/SA9Uz-5ZweI/AAAAAAAAACE/j_mUMLFs-vc/s1600-h/naked.jpg"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_K0T9JgGHK5g/SA9Uz-5ZweI/AAAAAAAAACE/j_mUMLFs-vc/s400/naked.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192462147415294434" /></a><br /><br />Once that flew across my screen he was signed off before I could even reply to lengthen this exchange...
