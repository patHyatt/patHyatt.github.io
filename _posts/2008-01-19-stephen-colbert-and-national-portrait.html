<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Stephen Colbert from The Colbert Report recently was granted a limited showing in the
        National Portrait Gallery in D.C. this week with his portrait within portraits rendering. The question will his
        display be appreciated?<br /><br /></div><a

</div><br />Well the answer is an obvious yes. Not only was the Colbert display crowded with visitors, but there was a
line formed just to take pictures. On top of that, there were 2 security guards to keep the walkways clear and lots of
giddiness. By far the most crowded display I've seen in a museum here. Just amazing. I highly recommend visiting the
display if you have the ability. Its filled with young enthusiasm, laughter and a lack of stiffness you normally get
when in a museum.
