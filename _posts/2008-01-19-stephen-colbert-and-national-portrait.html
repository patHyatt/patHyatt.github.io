<div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">Stephen Colbert from The Colbert Report recently was granted a limited showing in the National Portrait Gallery in D.C. this week with his portrait within portraits rendering. The question will his display be appreciated?<br /><br /></div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_K0T9JgGHK5g/R5KSX4gMadI/AAAAAAAAABc/WJ8Wis0FvCY/s1600-h/colbert.JPG"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_K0T9JgGHK5g/R5KSX4gMadI/AAAAAAAAABc/WJ8Wis0FvCY/s400/colbert.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157345462294702546" border="0" /></a><br /></div><br />Well the answer is an obvious yes. Not only was the Colbert display crowded with visitors, but there was a line formed just to take pictures. On top of that, there were 2 security guards to keep the walkways clear and lots of giddiness. By far the most crowded display I've seen in a museum here. Just amazing. I highly recommend visiting the display if you have the ability. Its filled with young enthusiasm, laughter and a lack of stiffness you normally get when in a museum.
