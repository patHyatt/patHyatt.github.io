Ever since I was a gaming noob or programming wanna-be (I guess I still am this though) I've been interested in
computing ergonomics. Ergo mouse, ergo keyboard, ergo desk, ergo monitor configuration etc. While this puts me out as
the dude at work with the weird setup, it is surprising to see how many career developers don't even consider it. The
risks are <a rel="noopener"

use the <a rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Q5AlJr">Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000+ v1.0</a><br /><a
    href="https://compass-ssl.microsoft.com/assets/b1/12/b112ddfc-0541-4948-a804-a7268b0cc2a7.jpg?n=mk_nek4000v2_large.jpg"><img

        alt="Image of Microsoft Ergonomic 4000+ keyboard" /></a><br /><br /><br />This is a great keyboard.
Honestly...<br /><br />But there is one
thing that I can totally do without. Take a gander at that gigantic number and arrow pad section. It's basically 1/3 of
the keyboard in total. Imagine an ergonomic style keyboard (with wavy keys) without a number pad. This gigantic number
pad requires me to move my right arm an additional 8ish inches to the right causing some discomfort after long periods
of use. Now when I'm whipping out design elements on a windows form dragging and dropping things all over; the
additional mobility cost spent to rename default name properties is fatiguing. <br /><br />I imagine what it would be
like to have my keyboard not off set from the front of me or my mouse in an ideal location. The first keyboard maker
that comes out with this will have real market for this. With the continued research into repetitive stress injury and
computer related injuries (I realize that sounds crazy) will come the increased knowledge and want for extremely ergo
items.
