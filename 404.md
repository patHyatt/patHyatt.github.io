<div class="container">
	<h1>Something happened.</h1>
	<p>
		The page you wanted couldn't be found. It is *very* likely my fault.
	</p>
	<p>
		It would be extremely helpful and utterly appreciated if you would <a href="https://github.com/patHyatt/patHyatt.github.io/issues/new" target="_blank">open a new issue</a> and include the URL you originally wanted.
